<h2>Extraordinary <a href="/work/">work</a> from an extraordinarily normal guy.</h2>
<article>
    <p>I'm a developer, designer, entrepreneur and overall swell guy residing in the heart of the midwest. I'm an obsessor over details and thrive on learning new things. My passion is working with talented people where I can use my expertise to cultivate engaging relationships on the foundation of a common&nbsp;purpose.</p>
    <p>For over a decade, I've taken on challenging roles ranging from graphic engineer to lead developer for great companies all over the country. User interaction is the driving force in all of my work, whether it be pixel perfect design or strict web standards complaint markup; every detail&nbsp;matters.</p>
